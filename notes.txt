node tool to generate csv or something from json? could have from and to dates or everything


- find customer edit what after?
- filtering by date
- filtering by date download?
- when importing wait for all callbacks to complete???????

edit customers? ids would stay the same, edit entries too!
edit customer should find all book entries referencing it and update!
1. // sorting could probably be done via an index somehow on query for date desc on book entry!!!!!!!!!!
2. // finding customer may be could be done with an index and contains query?
3. rather than callbacks could use promises
